# llmir

A standardized intermediate representation for LLM-generated natural language outputs.

## What is LLM-IR?

LLM-IR provides a universal format for representing, processing, and transforming text generated by large language models. While protocols like MCP standardize how LLMs access information, LLM-IR standardizes how LLM outputs are structured and understood.

## Why?

- Preserve semantic structure and intent in LLM outputs
- Enable consistent processing across applications
- Simplify integration with downstream tools
- Provide a foundation for content management systems

## Core Components

1. **Parser**: Converts raw LLM text to structured IR
2. **Transformer**: Validates and modifies content in IR format
3. **Generator**: Converts IR to various output formats (text, markdown, HTML, JSON)

## Current Status

- Early development of core data structures
- Basic parser with block and entity detection
- Output generators for multiple formats
- Command-line demonstration tool

## Next Steps

- [ ] Enhanced NLP capabilities
- [ ] Content validation rules
- [ ] Storage and retrieval system
- [ ] macOS clipboard integration
- [ ] Documentation and examples
